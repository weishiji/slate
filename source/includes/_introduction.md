# Introduction

Welcome to the OceanEx trading API! You can use our API to access OceanEx endpoints, which can get information and place orders on various markets. Some API supports both `get` and `post` method, but we strongly recommend only to use `post` method for all API requests.

Currently, we only have language bindings in Python. Other languages like Shell, Ruby, and JavaScript are coming soon. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.
